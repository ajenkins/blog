# Why I wrote this

Since writing [my last post on the metaverse](/post/metaverse) I've
been thinking more about web3, blockchain, and NFTs. I also
read an interesting blog post from Max Read
["Is web3 bullshit?"](https://maxread.substack.com/p/is-web3-bullshit).
In that post he breaks down the question "is web3 bullshit?" into two
specific sub-questions that serve as a "personality test" for where you
stand on web3:

> Can the blockchain do anything that other currently existing technology cannot
> do and/or do anything better or more efficiently than other currently existing
> technology?
>
> Will the blockchain form the architecture of the internet of the future
> (i.e. "web3"), and/or will blockchain-native companies and organizations
> become important and powerful?

I also read [this article on The Verge](https://www.theverge.com/22824387/bored-ape-yacht-club-nft-party-new-york)
about an exclusive party for people
who own one of the 10,000 Bored Ape Yacht Club NFTs. Which confirmed
my belief that people who buy NFTs are weird and I don't want one.<a href="#footnote-1" class="footnote">[1]</a>

# Where I stand on the "web3 is bullshit" spectrum

Using the classification system from the Max Read post, I'm in the
yeah?/kinda camp.
