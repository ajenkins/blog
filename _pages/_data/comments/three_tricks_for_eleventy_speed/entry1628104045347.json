With your help, I'm at least getting partial outputs. And I understand a little better how the input and output paths are supposed to work.\r\n\r\nIt's still not working quite right for me, however, I'm trying to use it in a loop in a template, to output thumbnail pictures from many posts. It produces output for the first in the list (the most recent post), but after that the props, and props.url variable are always \"undefined\".\r\n\r\nI have to say, I don't understand where the 'url' variable in this line comes from:\r\nreturn `<img src=\"${props.url}\" width=\"${props.width}\" height=\"${props.height}\" alt=\"${alt}\">`;\r\nIs that just a built in property you get with the plug-in?","date":"2021-08-04T19:07:25.346Z"}
