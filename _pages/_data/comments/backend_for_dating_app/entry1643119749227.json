I ended up going with Postgraphile for the backend and am happy with it so far. We're planning to deploy it serverless, and are using NextJS for the frontend. I also am using Clerk for auth, that is a great new service and recommended!\r\n\r\nI'd be interested in how it went, please consider posting a reflection on your experiences after having implemented this stack amd run it for a while!","date":"2022-01-25T14:09:09.226Z"}
