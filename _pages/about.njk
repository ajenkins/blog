  <h1>About me</h1>
  <p>
    Hi, welcome to my blog. My name is AJ Jenkins (he/him).
    I'm <span id="my-age"></span> years old and I live in Boston, MA.
    As of {{ page.date.getFullYear() }}, I'm working as an engineering manager at a healthcare tech company.
    You can see what I'm doing now on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/aj-jenkins-73113343/">LinkedIn</a>.
  <p>

  <p>
    Pictured above is me in 2019 with the cat who lives with me sometimes.
    His name is Percy.
    If you're wondering, I didn't train him to sit on my shoulders.
    He trained me to stand still whenever he wanted to sit on my shoulders üò∏
  </p>

  <p>
    I like movies, video games, anime, EDM, science, technology, and sailing.
    I made this blog because I had some ideas for blog posts that I wasn't
    seeing other people write about online and I thought other people might want to read.
    But the internet is a big place, so I'm probably not as original as I think I am ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
    I have no intention of trying to make money from this blog. I also don't want anyone
    else to profit off of my blog, which is why I decided to self-host
    (I'm using <a href="https://www.netlify.com">Netlify</a>).
